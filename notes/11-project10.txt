npm i --save @apollo/client graphql redux reselect

// download the schema to the frontend
"schema:download": "npx apollo service:download --endpoint=https://anilist.co/graphql ./src/app/graphql/graphql-schema.json"

we had folder called selector and we added the code below so this selector will return what is inside animeList to make things a bit easier 
import { createSelector } from "reselect";
import { IRootState } from "../../types";

const selectHome = (state: IRootState) => state.home;

export const makeSelectAnimeList = createSelector(
  selectHome,
  (home) => home.animeList
);
