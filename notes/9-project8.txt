npm i mdb-react-ui-kit react-router-dom react-


const { name } = useSelector((state) => ({ ...state.auth }));
but in the slice I added:
export const selectAuth = (state: RootState) => state.auth;
const { name } = useAppSelector(selectAuth); // useAppSelector rather than useSelector because of typescript, it comes with the template with redux typescript

protected route:
add a generic component
export const PrivateRoute = ({ children }: { children: any }) => {
  const { token } = useSelector(selectAuth);
  return token ? children : <LoadingToRedirect />;
};
and in the routes
<Route
    path="/dashboard"
    element={
        <PrivateRoute>
        <Dashboard />
        </PrivateRoute>
    }
/>
